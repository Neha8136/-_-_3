# Iris Flower Classification
                                                  Introduction on Classification
In this project of Iris Flowers Classification, we will be dealing with Logistic Regression Machine Learning Algorithm. We all know about Iris Dataset, and it contains features of different flower species. Independent features in this dataset are Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, and Petal Width. All these lengths were in centimeters. And Dependent feature, which will be the output for the model, is Species. It contains the name of the species to which that particular flower with those measurements belongs.

             Logistic Regression
Logistic Regression is a supervised machine learning model used mainly for categorical data, and it is a classification algorithm. It is one of the widely used algorithms for classification using machine learning. Seeing the name logistic regression, you may think it will be a regression algorithm. But the fact is that it is a classification algorithm, and it is a generalization of the linear regression model.
